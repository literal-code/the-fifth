                    <div class="sonic-box">Sonic The Hedgehog, released by Sega in 1991, revolutionized platformers with its lightning-fast speed and momentum-based gameplay. Sonic's iconic blue character quickly became Sega's beloved mascot, rivaling Mario in popularity. The game's spin dash move and intricate level designs filled with loops and ramps added a dynamic element to the genre. Sonic's success led to numerous sequels, spin-offs, and a cultural impact that can still be felt today, inspiring modern platformers and solidifying its place as a legendary franchise. From its vibrant aesthetics to its rebellious attitude, Sonic The Hedgehog left an indelible mark on the platformer genre.</div>
